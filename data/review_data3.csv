2702,0,I was so excited to finally buy a kindle and the deal offered on the 20th anniversary was too good to pass up. The 16 gigs were sold out so I settled on the 8 gig. I downloaded one movie to watch on an upcoming trip since I would be flying. Immediately after I saw a message saying my storage was low. I only had like 300 megabytes left. One movie took of 3 gigs and I assume the rest was taken up my operating systems. I purchased the movie vs renting it and now I will have to erase the movie if I plan to ever use the tablet again. I'm actually thinking about sending the kindle back.,excited finally kindle deal offered anniversary good pass gigs sold settled downloaded movie watch upcoming trip since would flying Immediately message saying storage like megabytes left movie took gigs assume rest taken operating systems purchased movie renting erase movie plan ever tablet actually thinking sending kindle back,"['excited', 'finally', 'kindle', 'deal', 'offer', 'anniversary', 'good', 'pass', 'gig', 'sell', 'settle', 'download', 'movie', 'watch', 'upcoming', 'trip', 'since', 'would', 'fly', 'immediately', 'message', 'say', 'storage', 'like', 'megabyte', 'leave', 'movie', 'take', 'gig', 'assume', 'rest', 'take', 'operating', 'system', 'purchase', 'movie', 'rent', 'erase', 'movie', 'plan', 'ever', 'tablet', 'actually', 'think', 'send', 'kindle', 'back']"
